# Get Location Project ðŸ’¥

<br />

## Description ðŸ’¬

This project is a React application that utilizes a custom useGeolocation hook to fetch the user's current geographic coordinates using the browser's geolocation API. The app displays a button labeled "Get my position" that, when clicked, retrieves and shows the user's latitude and longitude. If the browser doesn't support geolocation or an error occurs, it provides an error message. The coordinates are also linked to OpenStreetMap for further exploration. Additionally, the app tracks how many times the user has requested their position, displaying a count of the button clicks.
